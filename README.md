About Me:
My name is Vivian Salas and I am 23 years old. I am going to school to learn more about programming and how to build new projects. Once I graduate, I plan to be a full-stack web developer or a software developer at a company that I value. Some technical skills that I have are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python. Some of my hobbies include going to the gym, reading books, and playing Fortnite.
